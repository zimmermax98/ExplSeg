## Description 
 Applying traditional post-hoc attribution methods to segmentation or object detection predictors offers only limited insights,
 as the obtained feature attribution maps at input level typically resemble the modelsâ€™ predicted segmentation mask or bounding box.
 In this work, we address the need for more informative explanations for these predictors by proposing
 the post-hoc eXplainable Artificial Intelligence method **L-CRP** to
 **generate explanations that automatically identify and visualize relevant concepts** learned, recognized and used by the model
 during inference as well as precisely locate them in input space.
 Our method therefore goes beyond singular input-level attribution maps and, 
 as an approach based on the Concept Relevance Propagation technique,
 is efficiently applicable to state-of-the-art black-box architectures.

L-CRP (center) goes beyond traditional local heatmaps (left) or latent activation analysis (right), 
by communicating which latent concepts contributed to a particular detection, to what degree in terms of relevance (R)
and where concepts are precisely located in input space.</p>

<p style="width: 700px;">
L-CRP explanations of the YOLOv6 (left) and DeepLabV3+ (right).
It is apparent that the models use background features, such as the kite for the detection of a person (left)
or the horizontal bar (blue color concept) for the segmentation of the horse (right).

# How-To:

## 1) Rendering of L-CRP explanations

In order to render an L-CRP explanation, we need to first perform a glocal preprocessing step.
The glocal preprocessing step is performed via the `run_glocal_analysis.sh` script in the `scripts` directory.

Note, that this step can be skipped if you want to render explanations for the provided checkpoints. 
All L-CRP preprocessing files can be downloaded [**here**](https://datacloud.hhi.fraunhofer.de/s/jXr9C4nc3QzdgDK) and should be saved in the `outputs/crp` directory.

After the glocal preprocessing step, we can render L-CRP explanations via the `experiments/plot_crp_explanation.py` script.


# Paper Reproducibility

To reproduce all the results of our paper, please adhere to the submitted code for the CVPR 2023 workshop, which is provided 
[**here**](https://datacloud.hhi.fraunhofer.de/s/GqyC8tpe3zXMzXX).

This repository is adapted from the submitted code to be more user-friendly,
and contains the exact same model checkpoints and datasets.
